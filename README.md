# Securing Network with  OpenSSL

## What is SSL

- SSL stands for Secure Socket Layer
- Network Protocol which runs on in between presentation layer and Transport layer
- Now SSL has  successor which is  called  TLS  stands for Transport Layer Security

## Why We need SSL/TLS

- SSL/TLS is used for securing connection between systems so that they can share important information and no one other can read or modify it.

- SSL/TLS basically use encryption algorithms to encrypt that data and share keys only to system who are communicating with each other

## How To Get SSL Certificate?

Its Easy, as there are many companies which sell SSL encryption certificate service.

## What is OpenSSL

- It is open-source cryptographic library.
- Written  in C, Assembly and Perl
- It  is  used  for  data  encryption
- It  has  various encryption algorithm and provide many encryption tools
- SSL/TLS  is  one  of  encryption tool provided by OpenSSL <br />

## History Of OpenSSL

- Released on 23 December 1998 by OpenSSL Project Team
- In  2019  OpenSSL  is  managed  by  OpenSSL  management  committee
- This project budget is around one million per year which primarily completed by donations <br />

## How OpenSSL is Work
Open SSL architecture is divided into 4 parts
1. libcrypto
2. libssl
3. Engine
4. Application Component

### Libcrypto
- It is general purpose cryptographic library which contains all various cryptographic services used in OpenSSL
- It  also  provide supporting services which are used by libssl  which  handle  SSL/TLS  in  OpenSSL
![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/95keshav/openssl/main/supporting%20services.png)
### Libssl
- This library depends upon libcrypto
- It handle the TLS protocols and its execution
![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/95keshav/openssl/main/libssl.png)

### Engine
- They are Dynamically modules registered with libcrypto to help it to run cryptographic algorithms
- It is  the  hardware and software implementations  used to run cryptographic algorithms
- Used  as  hardware accelerator for these algorithms

### Application Component
*“Applications are  set  of  command  –line tools  that  use  the  underlaying  libcrypto and libssl components to provide cryptographic and other features like*[[1]](#1)

1. *Key and parameter generation and inspection*
2.  *Certificate  generation and inspection*
3.  *SSL/TSL test  tools*
4. *ASN.1 Inspection”*
